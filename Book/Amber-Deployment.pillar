!Deploying Applications

Deploying Amber applications can be done by using ==grunt== commands.

In order to deploy the application with all Javascript in a single file, use the ==grunt deploy== command.

This will build the application and all Javascript will end up in a file named ==thejs.js==.

[[[
$grunt deploy
]]]

For development, the command is ==grunt devel==.

[[[
$grunt devel
]]]
